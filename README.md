# Treehouse Techdegree Project 6

## Static Node.js and Express Site

### Modifications

### Fonts
I switched the font face to Open sans from google fonts to make the site look a little more modern. 

### Animations
I Used somme simple css transforms to add to the project thumbnails and the profile picture. The project thumbnails scale up a little bit while hovering. The profile picture slightly rotates. 

### Style Changes
I Changed the sidebar background color and font colors so its not as dark.


### Run The App
To run the app: 
`npm install`
`npm start`

if you want to run nodemon in development 
`npm startdev`
